### We run on GitHub
We use GitHub to host documents and files, track issues and manage testing, as well as accept pull requests.

### Clone the repo and create your local copy from master.
If you make any changes, issue that pull request!

### Request document changes using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public review/edits. Comment or suggest an edit by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Write issues with detail and suggested changes
Make sure to include the heading, what the issue is and the recommended changes

### Use a consistent style
We will develop a style guideline

### All code changes happen through pull requests
