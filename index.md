# 3D PDF Interoperability Forum (3DPDF-IF)
Welcome to the 3D PDF Interoperability Forum web page.

## Epic 1 / Sprint 2

### Scope
The goal of this sprint is to create and test PDF 2.0 files that have RichMedia annotations with 3D assets.

### Files

We use GitHub to manage all the files used in a 3DPDF-IF epic ([find it here](https://github.com/3D-PDF-Consortium/3DPDF-IF-Epic-1)). Click the green Code button and select "Download Zip" to get the current copies of all the sprint files (STEP files, RichMedia annotation documents and example, etc.)

You are also welcome to add or edit the files used in this epic. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is great for managing any contributions you make to the epic repository. To make changes, create a local clone of the repository, edit the documents locally, then commit and issue a push request to check your changes in! All changes will be reviewed before being merged.

We are happy to help with all things related to 3D PDF , the 3D PDF Consortium or this repository. Email us at info@3dpdfconsortium.org to get in touch..
